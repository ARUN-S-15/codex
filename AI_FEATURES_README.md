## ⚙️ How It Works

### With API Key:
- ✅ AI-powered analysis
- ✅ Context-aware explanations
- ✅ Multi-language optimization
- ✅ Educational insights

### Without API Key:
- ✅ Still works perfectly!
- ✅ Uses rule-based system (your old code)
- ✅ Python pattern optimization
- ✅ No features break

**Best part:** You don't NEED the API key for the app to work, but it makes it **10x smarter**!

## 💰 Cost

**FREE!** 🎉
- No credit card required
- 1,500 requests/day
- Perfect for learning & development

## 🎮 Try These Examples

### Example 1: Inefficient Loop
```python
# Paste in Optimizer
result = []
for i in range(1000):
    if i % 2 == 0:
        result.append(i)
```

**AI will suggest:**
```python
result = [i for i in range(1000) if i % 2 == 0]
```

### Example 2: Nested Loops
```python
# Paste in Optimizer
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(n):
        if arr[i] == arr[j]:
            found = True
```

**AI will suggest:**
```python
# Use set for O(n) instead of O(n²)
arr_set = set(arr)
found = len(arr) != len(arr_set)
```
