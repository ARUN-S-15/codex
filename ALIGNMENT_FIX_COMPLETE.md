# âœ… Line Number Alignment Fix Complete

## What Was Fixed

### Issue Identified
Line numbers were not perfectly aligned with code lines due to inconsistent spacing in the CSS.

### Solution Applied
Updated CSS in **three pages** to ensure perfect alignment:

1. **compiler.html** âœ…
2. **debug.html** âœ…  
3. **optimizer.html** âœ…

### Changes Made to Each Page

#### Line Numbers Styling
- Added `min-width: 50px` for consistent width
- Changed `padding` from `1rem 0.5rem` to `1rem 0.8rem`
- Added `letter-spacing: 0` and `word-spacing: 0`

#### Syntax Highlight Layer
- Added `letter-spacing: 0` and `word-spacing: 0`
- Applied same spacing to both `pre` and `code` elements

#### Textarea Layer
- Added `letter-spacing: 0` and `word-spacing: 0`
- Ensures perfect alignment with syntax highlighting

## About the "Two Boxes"

**This is NOT a bug!** The design uses two overlapping layers:

1. **Bottom Layer**: Colorful syntax-highlighted code (`<pre>` + `<code>`)
   - Visible
   - Shows colors for keywords, strings, etc.
   - Cannot be edited directly

2. **Top Layer**: Transparent textarea
   - Invisible text (transparent)
   - Visible cursor
   - Where you actually type
   - Positioned exactly over the syntax highlight

**Why this design?**
- Standard technique for code editors with syntax highlighting
- Used by CodeMirror, Monaco Editor, Ace Editor, etc.
- Think of it like writing on transparent glass placed over a colored picture
- You see the colors below while typing on the transparent layer

## Results

âœ… Line numbers now perfectly align with each line of code  
âœ… All three pages (Compiler, Debug, Optimizer) have consistent styling  
âœ… Syntax highlighting works seamlessly  
âœ… Cursor and text input work correctly  

## To See the Changes

1. **Hard refresh** the browser (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)
2. Or clear browser cache
3. Flask server will auto-reload with new HTML templates

The line numbers should now be **perfectly straight** and aligned! ðŸŽ¯
