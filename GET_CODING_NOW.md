## 💡 Why Not Docker?

Docker Judge0 needs Linux cgroup v1 which Windows Docker Desktop doesn't fully support. Your options were:

1. **RapidAPI** ✅ - Works immediately, perfect for development
2. **Linux Server** - Would work but needs deployment
3. **Keep Debugging Docker** - Uncertain, could take hours

You chose wisely! 🚀
